# Interactive Content Creation with TreeWriter

- interactive content creation
  - interactive content: users **read** (consume content) and **choose** (interact with content)
  - challenge: it have been expensive for content creators to produce multi-branch, more complex content
  - solution: utilize LLM to assist/automate the creation process
- compare: traditional content
  - users will have a non-linear, interactive experience that may increase their engagement and attachment
  - creation of this kind of content has much more challenges than traditional content creation
- compare: dialog-based interactive systems
  - cost less to interact with the system: users don't _write_
  - have more control over the content
- examples:
  - interactive fiction
  - NPC conversation in games
  - easy assistant (we can see them as interactive user manuals)
