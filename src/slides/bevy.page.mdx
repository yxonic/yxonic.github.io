# Introduction

- Bevy is a game engine that provides first-class low-level mechanisms for game developing
- Instead of feature-full, Bevy is more like "mechanism-full"
- We may use these mechanisms to create our own features, strategies, fancy ideas, and eventually, _games_
- Building games from low-level mechanisms is overwhelming at first. We want to alleviate this initial pain.
- This guide takes a top-down approach to give you a creator's guidance to learning Bevy.
- Some questions I will try to answer:
  - How to start creating from scratch?
  - When creating something, what mechanisms can you use?
  - When you want to change something, what parts should you adjust?

# Brief introduction to Bevy

- Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. _(https://bevyengine.org)_
- Compared with other game engines, Bevy is representing and tracking the internal data more elegantly
  - it helps you materialize the imaginary game world as concrete data
  - it organizes data as Entity-Component-System (ECS), a time-tested paradigm seen in many other engines
  - ...yet it leverages advanced Rust features to make it refreshingly simple for us to use
- How is my experience working with Bevy?
  - Accurate: I fully control the code, the code fully controls the game world
  - Confident: less unexpected behaviors or mysterious bugs, thanks to Rust and Bevy's clear architecture
  - Creative: put things together creatively, or craft your own features, all as I want
  - Agile: I can build, publish and iterate your game real quick

# Quickstart `ch01`

- Launch the game
- Import a model
- See through a camera
- Move objects
- Respond to events
- Manage behaviors with states
- Recap

# Launch the game `ch01/step-1`

- Install Rust: [Rust official guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started), [Bevy Book installing rust and OS dependencies](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#rust-setup)
- Start a new project:
  ```bash
  cargo new learn_bevy_game
  cd learn_bevy_game
  ```
- Add Bevy as dependency (with a link-time optimization):
  ```bash
  cargo add bevy --features dynamic_linking
  ```
- Apply an optimization for debugging experience: add the following lines to `Cargo.toml`
  ```toml
  [profile.dev.package."*"]
  opt-level = 3
  ```
- Test the game (which is just a hello world program for now):
  ```bash
  cargo run # this could take some time; later builds would be a lot faster
  ```
- Read more about the optimizations and building commands: [bevy book](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/), [unofficial bevy cheatbook](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/pitfalls/performance.html)

# Import a model `ch01/step-2-1`

- Setup a window, a main game loop, and other main features with `DefaultPlugins`
  - Bevy at its core is just a skeleton for supporting the ECS paradigm
  - a new Bevy app contains nothing; we add ECS to it to give it meanings
  - a plugin is a pack of ECS items that work together to handle a specific aspect of the game
  - window management, game loop, input management, logging, are all supported through some default plugins

---

# Import a model `ch01/step-2-2`

- [Download](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/raw/main/assets/models/animated/Fox.glb) a model to `assets/models/Fox.glb`
  - you can design your 3D model _visually_ with software like Blender
  - then you can export it to formats like glTF (or its binary version `.glb`) to use it _programmatically_ in Bevy
- Load this model in Bevy app
  - in the code we add `load_scene_system` at `Startup` phase of the game
  - scene is kind of like a container; we can put one or more models, lights and cameras together as a scene
  - here we load a scene with an `AssetServer`, and spawn it in `load_scene_system` (systems are just functions)
    ```rs
    commands.spawn(SceneBundle {
        scene: asset_server.load("models/Fox.glb#Scene0"),
        ..default()
    });
    ```
- Observe it in the window with a camera
  - let's set up a default camera for now
    ```rs
    commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle::default());
    ```

---

# Import a model

- Now run the game with `cargo run`, you'll see something like this:

<div class="grid px-32">

![part of the fox](/imgs/bevy/ch01_2_2.png)

</div>

---

# See through a camera

- We are now already seeing the 3D game world in the window, through a _camera_
- The mechanism of a camera
  - without a camera, the world is just a bunch of data describing what everything is and where they are
  - a camera uses such information to calculate what we should see from a certain point of view
  - specifically, given object shapes, positions, environment lightings, etc., the camera will compute colors of each pixels on the screen, as if we were seeing things directly from there; this process is called _rendering_

---

# See through a camera `ch01/step-3`

- Let's move our camera to a more comfortable position [TODO]
  - https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/features/coords.html
  - https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/features/transforms.html
- Then, we add some lights to make this scene look more natural [TODO]
  - https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/3d/load_gltf.rs
- Also change background color to give us a more lively feel [TODO]

---

# Move objects

- Write a system to move the fox around [TODO]
- Trigger an animation when moving [TODO]
  - https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/animation/animated_fox.rs

---

# Respond to events

- Bind systems to keyboard events [TODO]
- The discreteness of time, i.e. frames [TODO]

---

# Manage behaviors with states

- Fox state: running, idle [TODO]
- Make the fox come back after idling for some while [TODO]

---

# Recap

- Game development mindset
  - describe the game world
  - game $\to$ player: what will player see (with rendering)
  - player $\to$ game: how will our game react to players (with events)
  - the evolution of the game world: state machines
