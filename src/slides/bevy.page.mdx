# Introduction

- Bevy is a game engine that provides first-class low-level mechanisms
- Instead of feature-full, Bevy is more like "mechanism-full"
- We may use these mechanisms to create our own features, strategies, fancy ideas, and eventually, *games*
- Building games from low-level mechanisms is overwhelming at first. We want to alleviate this initial pain.
- This book takes a top-down approach to give you a creator's guidance. We try to answer:
  - How to start creating from scratch?
  - When creating something, what mechanisms can you use?
  - When you want to change something, what parts should you adjust?
